The aim of this thesis is to develop a Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) Android application for indoor navigation to help customers find a particular product shelf in a small and closed place. This includes creating a website where the user can see all available products divided by categories in a table. The user can access the website from the mobile application and search for a certain product. The application is using a digital twin of the retail store to help users find the closest path from their location to the shelf where the searched product is placed. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a real object or place, in this case it is a 3D map of the store. Knowledge about all available products in the retail environment and their shelf location is obtained from a knowledge graph, which is a collection of organized and linked data visualized as a graph.
