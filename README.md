# AR-Path-Planning
The aim is to develop an AR Android indoor navigation app to help customers find the shortest route from their location to a specific product shelf in a store. This includes creating a PHP website which shows all available products taken from a knowledge graph, divided by category. The app uses a digital twin of the store (3D map). Created in 2022.
